    On your turn any spell that is currently active with a duration can be
    converted to a focus spell. You can also do this to spells that would have
    ended in your turn.
  </p>
  <p>
    To convert a spell into a focus spell you must expend mana equal to half
    your intelligence (rounded up). Every turn you must expend this mana to keep
    the spell going. Once you stop expending the mana, the spell's effects end
    instantly.
