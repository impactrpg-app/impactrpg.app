    Mana is used to cast spells. Without mana it is not possible to cast a
    spell.
  </p>
  <p>During combat you can spend an action to channel mana.</p>
  <h4>Maximum Mana</h4>
  <p>
    You can have as much mana as you want. But if you have more mana than your
    endurance then you may suffer an injury.
  </p>
  <h4>Mana Limit</h4>
  <p>
    The amount of mana you can spend in a single turn is double your
    intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wearing armor imposes penalities to your mana limit. Lower your mana limit
    by your armor value.
  </p>
  <h4>Channeling Mana</h4>
  <p>
    Any player may spend 1 endurance to do an intelligence check. The player
    gains double the successes rolled as mana.
  </p>
  <p>During rest, if you sleep your mana is set to double your intelligence.</p>
