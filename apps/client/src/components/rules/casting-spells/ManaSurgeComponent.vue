    Magic is inherently volatile, even for seasoned spellcasters. A mana surge occurs
    under two conditions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Failed Channeling:</b> If you attempt to channel mana and gain no successes.
    </li>
    <li><b>Mana Overload:</b> If your current mana exceeds your endurance value.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>When a Mana Surge Happens</h4>
  <p>Current mana is lost.</p>
  <p>You suffer an Injury (roll on the injury table).</p>
