  <p>Some spells affect multiple targets.</p>
  <p>For each new target divide the amount of mana by 2 then round up.</p>
  <p>
    Each target is affected as if the spell was cast individually with the adjusted mana.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      When doing an attack targeting 3 characters you may spend 5 mana to do 2 potential
      wounds on each target (roll 2 dice as an attack roll for each target).
    </i>
