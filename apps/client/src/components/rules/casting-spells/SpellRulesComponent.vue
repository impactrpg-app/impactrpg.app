    The act of channeling mana draws upon the latent energy in the world, but it
    also taxes the body. Greater control over this process enables more potent
    spells.

  <h4>MAGIC NULL ZONES</h4>
  <p>
    Certain areas lack magical energy. In these zones, all dice for channeling
    mana roll have a penalty applied to them. Depending on the zone, this
    penalty can increasing making it impossible to channel any mana.

  <h4>Magic Cannot</h4>
  <p>
    Magic is raw energy. While it interacts with the physical world, it cannot
    create matter or life.

    <b>Resurrect a character</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Resurrecting anyone is beyond the understanding of mortals. If you wish to
    resurrect someone, you must ask a higher power for assistance. Please look
    at the resurrection section.

    <b>Create objects or resources.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    You cannot create objects or resources from nothing. If you conjure food,
    when you eat it the food will disapear inside your belly leaving you hungry.
