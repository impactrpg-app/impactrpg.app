    You must spend an action to channel mana by doing an intelligence check.
    Therefore, in combat you can only channel mana once per turn.
  </p>
  <p>
    Casting a spell does not require an action and you can cast as many spells
    as you want, as long as you have the mana to cast them.
  </p>
  <p>Pouring more mana into a spell typically yields stronger effects.</p>
  <p>
    However, you may use more mana to increase the range, area or duration of
    the effect.
