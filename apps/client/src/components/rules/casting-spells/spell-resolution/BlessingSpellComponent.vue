  <h3>BLESSING SPELLS</h3>
  <p>
    Blessings can enhance a creatures abilities (strength, agility and
    intelligence).
  </p>
  <p>
    To increase a creature's ability, select the creature and roll dice equal to
    the number of mana points spent.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the spell to function you will need successes equal to the creature's
    ability score.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any additional successes will increase how long the spell lasts. You cannot
    increase the ability more than 1 point in a single round.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      Increasing the an ability from 3 to 4 requires at least 3 successes for a
      single round. Spending 5 successes would increase the duration to 3 rounds
      but only increases the ability score by 1.
