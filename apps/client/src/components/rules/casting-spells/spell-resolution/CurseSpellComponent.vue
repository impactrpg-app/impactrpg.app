  <h3>CURSE SPELLS</h3>
  <p>
    Curses impose negative effects on enemies, such as Hold Person, Slow, Fear,
    or Polymorph.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each type of curse has a minimum requirement for the successes that are
    required. If the successes rolled are lower than this amount then the curse
    will simply fail immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
    The minimum successes requirement for each curse is set by the DM. Below is
    the recomended advice for minimum successes requirements.
  </p>

  <h4>APPLY A CURSE</h4>
  <p>When you apply a curse to a target, roll dice equal to the mana spent.</p>
  <p>
    The target rolls against you with their intelligence. For each success the
    target rolls, you remove one of your successes.
  </p>
  <p>
    As long as your successes are greater or equal to the requirement after
    being cancelled from the target's intelligence check, the curse applies.
