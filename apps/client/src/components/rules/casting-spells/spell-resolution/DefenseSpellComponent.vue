  <h3>DEFENSE SPELLS</h3>
  <p>
    Defense spells increase a creature's armor value. This can cause attacks to
    miss or be blocked by an invisible barrier.
  </p>
  <p>Pick a creature and roll dice equal to the number of mana points spent.</p>
  <p>
    For the spell to function you will need successes equal to the creature's
    armor value.
  </p>
  <p>
    The spell will last until your next turn. Any additional successes will
    increase how long the spell lasts.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may increase the armor value multiple times if you have enough successes
    to meet the requirement.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      If a creature has 2 armor, you will need 2 successes to increase the armor
      by 1. You will need 5 (2 + 3) successes to increase the armor by 2.
