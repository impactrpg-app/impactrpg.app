  <h3>HEALING SPELLS</h3>
  <p>
    When removing a character's wounds; Roll dice equal to the number of mana spent.
  </p>
  <p>
    As long as you have more successes than the character's wounds, you remove 1 wound.
    This process repeats until all successes are used up.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the number of successes are less than the character's wounds, then nothing happens
    and the successes are wasted.
  </p>
  <p>To heal 3 wounds at the same time you will need to spend 5 successes (3 + 2 + 1).</p>
