  <h3>ILLUSION SPELLS</h3>
  <p>
    You can do anything with illusion magic, even break the rules by resurrecting or conjuring objects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every mana you spend when casting illusion magic will be used to inhance the illusion.
    If you want a visual and an audio illusion than you must spend a minimum of 2 mana.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you cast an illusion spell, you must roll dice equal to the mana spent.
    As long as you have more successes than the character's intelligence,
    then the illusion is successful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Illusion magic has no effect and does not do damage, protect allies, heal creatures or modify anything.
    It is only capable of making people belive something that is not true.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you cast illusion magic multiple times against the same character then each subsequent time you have
    a penalty of 1 to the dice roll.
