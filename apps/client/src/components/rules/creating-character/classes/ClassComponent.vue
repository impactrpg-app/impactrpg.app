    Character Classes are a list of predefined skills to give you a direction
    for your character.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can either follow the full skill tree or mix in other skills from
    different classes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some skills have a pre-requisite. You cannot take the skill "Hide 2" without
    first getting "Hide 1".
