  <p>
    When attacking another character you use your action to roll dice equal to
    <b class="text-contrast">your strength + weapons attack value</b>. Each of
    the success on the attack roll represents a wound on the character.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any character that is attacked will make a defense roll. Roll dice equal to
    <b class="text-contrast">your agility + armor value</b>. Each success on the
    defense roll represents a wound that is negated.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the attack roll is greater than the defense roll, the attack is
    successful and the character takes damage equal to the difference between
    the attack roll and defense roll.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the attack roll is equal to the defense roll or the defense roll is
    greater, the attack is blocked and the character takes no damage.
