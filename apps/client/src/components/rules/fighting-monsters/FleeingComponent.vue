    To flee combat, you use an action to move as far as you can from all
    enemies. Then roll an agility check to flee combat.
  </p>
  <p>
    The DM will set a target number based on the number of enemies and how
    difficult it is to flee.
  </p>
  <p><b>On Success</b> You escape, and enemies cannot persue you.</p>
  <p><b>On Failure</b> You remain in combat.</p>
