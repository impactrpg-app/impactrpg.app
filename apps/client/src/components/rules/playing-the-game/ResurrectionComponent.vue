    When a player character dies, they can be brought back to life through a ritual. This
    ritual involves communing with a god, requesting their intervention to resurrect the
    fallen character.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only player characters can be resurrected using this method. Non-player characters are
    not eligible.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ritual does not guarantee contact with the desired god. You might reach a
    different entity, such as a daemon, whose resurrection comes with its own risks and
    conditions.
  </p>
  <h3>RESURRECTION PAYMENT</h3>
  <p>
    Resurrection always comes at a cost. The entity performing the resurrection will
    demand payment after the character is revived. The payment is binding and directly
    affects the resurrected character or the party.
  </p>
  <p>
    The DM will determine a suitable payment based on the story. Alternatively, you can
    roll on the following table to decide the payment:
  </p>
  <p>
    <b class="text-contrast">1.</b>
    Sacrifice 2 large goods worth of items.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b class="text-contrast">2.</b>
    Undertake a quest to retrieve an item or artifact requested by the entity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b class="text-contrast">3.</b>
    Become a pawn of the resurrecting entity, compelled to do their bidding. Defying them
    results in punishment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b class="text-contrast">4.</b>
    Lose 1 skill of your choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b class="text-contrast">5.</b>
    Reduce the maximum wounds you can take by one.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b class="text-contrast">6.</b>
    Lower your maximum endurance by 2.
