  <p>Travel events add narrative depth to journeys. These events should be:</p>
  <p><b>Quick</b> They should not derail the main story.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Decision-Driven</b> The players must make meaningful choices, each with
    consequences.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Dynamic</b> Avoid repeating the same event too often unless players explore
    different outcomes.
  </p>
  <p><b>The DM May.</b></p>
