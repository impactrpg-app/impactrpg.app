    Mana is used to cast spells. Without mana it is not possible to cast a spell.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the start of each round do an intelligence check, each success turns into 1 mana.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your maximum mana is equal to double your intelligence modifier.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wearing armor imposes penalities to your maximum mana. Lower your maximum mana by
    the total armor value you are wearing.
  </p>
  <p>
    While out of combat you may do an intelligence roll to generate more mana but 
    you must expend 1 endurance to do so.
