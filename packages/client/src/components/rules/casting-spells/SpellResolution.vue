  <p>This section provides guidance for DMs on adjudicating spells.</p>
  <p>
    Spells can generally be categorized as one or more of the following: Attack, Defense,
    Bless, Curse, Utility, Healing, Summoning or illusion.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a player <b class="text-contrast">defines their intent</b> the DM will use this
    section to resolve the spell.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the player choose to cast a spell that both does damage and shields allies then the
    DM should follow attack rules for the enemies and defense rules for allies. Since
    multiple characters are involved the DM should follow the rules for multi-targeting.
