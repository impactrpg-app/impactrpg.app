  <h3>BLESSING SPELLS</h3>
  <p>Blessings enhance objects or willing creatures.</p>
  <p>
    To increase a creature's ability score, the mana spent must match or exceed the
    current ability score.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spending mana equal to the ability score will increase it by one for a single round.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any more mana added to the spell will increase the duration of the blessing, however the ability will not increase.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      Increasing the an ability from 3 to 4 requires at least 3 mana for a single round.
      Spending 5 mana would increase the duration to 3 rounds but only increases the
      ability score by 1.
