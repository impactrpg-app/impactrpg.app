    When a character attempts an uncertain action, the DM may call for an ability check to
    determine the outcome.
  </p>
  <p>The DM specifies the ability involved (e.g., Strength, Intelligence).</p>
  <p>Checks can only be attempted once; failure assumes all attempts have failed.</p>
  <p>
    Use six-sided dice (D6) for checks. Rolls of 4 or 5 yield 1 success and Rolls of 6
    yield 2 successes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The number of successes required depends on the task's difficulty, as set by the DM.
  </p>
  <p><b>Example</b></p>
  <p>
    DM:
    <i> "There's a gap to jump. Make an Easy Strength Check (2 successes)." </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    Player:
    <i>"I have 2 Strength and +1D6 from my Athletics skill. I'll roll 3D6." </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    Player rolls:
    <i>[2, 4, 5] â†’ 2 successes. </i>
  </p>
  <p>DM: <i>"You successfully jump the gap."</i></p>
