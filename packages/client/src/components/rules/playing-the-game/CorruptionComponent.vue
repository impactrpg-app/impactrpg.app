    <li>Witnessing horrifying events (e.g. massacres).</li>
    <li>Performing evil actions (e.g. killing innocents)</li>
    <li>Losing a party member</li>
  </ul>

    following effects.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Role-play as hopeless and defeatist, discouraging the group.</li>
    <li>Penalties to attack rolls, defense rolls and channeling magic.</li>
