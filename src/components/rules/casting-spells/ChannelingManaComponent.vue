  <h4>Expend Endurance</h4>
  <p>
    Spend an action to channel mana. When channeling mana choose how much endurance are
    you using to channel mana.
  </p>
  <h4>Generate Mana</h4>
  <p>
    Then do an intelligence check for every endurance lost; Adding up all of the successes
    for each check. All of those successes are turned into mana which can be used to cast
    spells.
  </p>
  <p>Mana persists until you rest or experience a mana surge.</p>
  <p>You may share your mana with any willing creature.</p>
  <p>
    Wearing armor imposes penalties to your Intelligence checks for channeling. The
    penalty equals the total armor value you are wearing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i> If wearing heavy armor (2 armor), you suffer a penalty of 2 dice. </i>
