  <h4>APPLY A CURSE</h4>
  <p>
    When you apply the curse on a target. Allocate the appropriate mana and then the
    target makes a defense roll against the mana allocated.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the roll is lower than the mana spent, the curse takes effect on the target for
    rounds equal to the mana spent divided by the mana required for the curse to activate.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      If the defender rolls 6 successes, while the mana spent is 8 to polymorph the target
      (skip their turn). This will result in the curse lasting 2 round.
    </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      If the defender rolls 5 successes, while the mana spent is 3. This will result in
      the curse failing to apply to the target.
    </i>
  </p>
