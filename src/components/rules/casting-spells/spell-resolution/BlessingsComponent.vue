  <h3>BLESSINGS</h3>
  <p>Blessings enhance objects or willing creatures.</p>
  <p>
    To increase a creature's ability score, the mana spent must match or exceed the
    current ability score.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      Increasing the an ability from 3 to 4 requires at least 3 mana for a single round.
      Spending 5 mana would increase the duration to 3 rounds but will not increase the
      ability score.
    </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    The mana spent determines how long the blessing lasts. However, there is a minimum
    limit on how much mana is required for the spell to function.
