  <h3>CURSE SPELLS</h3>
  <p>
    Curses impose negative effects on enemies, such as Hold Person, Slow, Fear, or
    Polymorph.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each type of curse has a minimum requirement for the mana that should be spent. If the
    mana spent is lower than this amount then the curse will simply fail immediately
  </p>
  <p>
    The minimum mana requirement for each curse is set by the DM. Below is the recomended
    advice for minimum mana requirements.
  </p>

      <tr>
        <td>Effect</td>
        <td>Required Successes</td>
      </tr>

        <td>Effecting movement</td>

  <h4>APPLY A CURSE</h4>
  <p>
    When you apply a curse to a target, make an attack roll equal to the mana spent.
  </p>
  <p>
    The target's armor value cancel's each success you get. From the remaining successes,
    if you have the required successes for the curse shown in the table above. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Then the curse applies to the target. Otherwise the curse fails and nothing happens.
