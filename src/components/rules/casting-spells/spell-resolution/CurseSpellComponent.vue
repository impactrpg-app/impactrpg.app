  <h3>CURSES</h3>
  <p>
    Curses impose negative effects on enemies, such as Hold Person, Slow, Fear, or
    Polymorph.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each type of curse has a minimum requirement for the mana that should be spent. If the
    mana spent is lower than this amount then the curse will simply fail immediately
  </p>
  <p>
    The minimum mana requirement for each curse is set by the DM. Below is the recomended
    advice for minimum mana requirements.
