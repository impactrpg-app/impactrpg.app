  <h3>ILLUSION SPELLS</h3>
  <p>
    You can do anything with illusion magic, even break the rules by resurrecting or conjuring objects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every mana you spend when casting illusion magic will be used to inhance the illusion.
    If you want a visual and an audio illusion than you must spend a minimum of 2 mana.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other characters will do an intelligence check against half the mana you spent (rounded up).
    If they get more successes than half of your spent mana, then the illusion fails.
  </p>
  <p>
    Illusion magic has no effect and does not do damage, protect allies, heal creatures or modify anything.
    It is only capable of making people belive something that is not true.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you cast illusion magic multiple times against the same character then each subsequent time they will
    need 1 less success to see through the illusion.
