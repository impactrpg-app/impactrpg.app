  <h3>SUMMONING SPELLS</h3>
  <p>
    To summon a creature you must spend mana for the amount of wounds the creature can handle.
    After the creature is summoned you must give the creature a purpose. The creature will
    act out the purpose you have described and once fullfilled or upon resting the creature
    will disapear.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you summon a creature it does not have any actions. However, when you cast a spell
    instead of the spells effect taking place you can imbue the spell to the creature.
    This will make the creature able to cast the spell you imbued into the creature.
