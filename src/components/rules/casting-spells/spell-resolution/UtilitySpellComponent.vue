  <h3>UTILITY SPELLS</h3>
  <p>
    These spells enable special actions, such as flying, lockpicking, or sealing doors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Treat utility spells as ability checks, using the mana spent as the successes rolled.
  </p>
  <p>
    Increase the target value required for utility spells by 1 when setting a target with
    the difficulty level table on ability checks section.
