    At character creation, you may select 1 different skills. Skills provide unique
    abilities or advantages, allowing you to customize your character's strengths and
    playstyle.

  <p>
    You cannot choose the same skill more than once but you may choose to upgrade the
    skill instead.

    A skill can be more than a bonus. It can give the character a unique ability or modify
    the rules. Players and DMs can work together to create unique skills for each player.
