    At the start of your turn, you gain one action. You can spend your action to do any of
    the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Attack</li>
    <li>Performing Maneuvers</li>
    <li>Throwing Items</li>
    <li>Casting Spell</li>
    <li>Or any other activity that comes to your imagination.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Most actions you perform will lower your endurance. This is how long you can last
    before your body gives up and you collapse to the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
    The DM may allow you to perform certain acts without spending your action. This can be
    such as drinking a potion or communicating with other characters.
