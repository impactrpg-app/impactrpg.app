  <p>Spend 1 action and 1 endurance to perform a maneuver.</p>
  <p>Describe the maneuver to the DM, then roll an attack as usual.</p>
  <p>
    If your attack roll succeeds (i.e., has more successes than the defender's roll), the
    maneuver takes effect instead of causing wounds.
  </p>
  <h5>Examples</h5>
  <p><b class="text-contrast">Grab:</b> The target can only attack you for 1 round.</p>
  <p>
    <b class="text-contrast">Knockdown:</b> The target's Agility is reduced to 0 for 1
    round.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b class="text-contrast">Intimidate:</b>
    The target suffers a penalty to their attack rolls.
