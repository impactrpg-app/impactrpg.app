    There are 3 different types of distances.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="text-contrast">
    Far
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can see the character and do ranged attacks.</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="text-contrast">
      Near
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can move in to do a melee attack in the same round.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="text-contrast">
      Close
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You are next to the character and can do a melee attack without moving.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a single round a character cannot move from far to Close or vise versa.
    However, a character can give up their main action to do this.
  </p>
