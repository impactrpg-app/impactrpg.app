  <p>
    Turn order is determined by agility, with the character who has the highest agility
    acting first.
  </p>
  <p>
    If multiple characters have the same agility, players always act before non-player
    characters.
  </p>
  <p>
    When player characters tie for agility, they may decide among themselves who acts
    first.
  </p>
  <h3>DELAYING YOUR TURN</h3>
  <p>
    You may choose to delay your turn by notifying the DM. This allows you to act at any
    point before your next turn.
  </p>
  <p>If you delay but fail to act before your next turn, the delayed action is lost.</p>
  <p>You cannot save or carry over unused delayed actions.</p>
