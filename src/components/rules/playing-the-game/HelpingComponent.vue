    When attempting an ability check, other players can assist to improve your chances of
    success. Each player helping you allows you to re-roll one die during your check.
  </p>
  <p>
    The DM may decide the maximum number of players who can assist, based on the
    situation.
  </p>
  <p><b>Examples</b></p>
  <p><i>Breaking down a door might allow up to two helpers.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i> Lockpicking is a solitary task and does not allow assistance. </i>
