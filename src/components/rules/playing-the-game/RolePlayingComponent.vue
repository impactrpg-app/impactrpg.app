    The DM sets the scene, describing the environment, challenges, and interactive
    elements. Players respond by narrating their characters' actions within the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Players and the DM collaborate to tell a cohesive story rather than compete against
    one another.
  </p>
  <p>
    Actions must align with the world's logic; impossible feats like flying without wings
    are not permitted.
