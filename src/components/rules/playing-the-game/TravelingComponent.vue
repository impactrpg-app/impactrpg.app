    When traveling across the world, distances are categorized into three types: Short,
    Far, and Journey. Each type of travel determines the number and frequency of Travel
    Events that the party will encounter.
  </p>
  <h3>TRAVEL DISTANCES</h3>
  <h4>Short</h4>
  <p>
    A short distance takes less than a day to complete. You can reach the destination and
    return the same day.
  </p>
  <p><b>Roll 1D6</b> for each success, trigger one travel event</p>
  <h4>Far</h4>
  <p>Far travel consumes most of the day. You will need to rest before heading back.</p>
  <p><b>Roll 2D6</b> for each success, trigger one travel event</p>
  <h4>Journey</h4>
  <p>
    Journey travel spans multiple days or even months. It requires preparation and
    endurance.
  </p>
  <p><b>Roll 2D6</b> for each success, trigger one travel event.</p>
  <p>
    Trigger 2 planned events on the travels. This can be combat focused or the players may
    come across a mini dungeon and key landmarks.
