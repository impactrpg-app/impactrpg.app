  <p>Wounds replace traditional health, adding urgency to survival.</p>

    Characters can sustain 5 wounds before perishing. You may find skills or gear that can
    increase the amount of wounds your character can take.

  <p>If a character takes 3 wounds from a single source, they also suffer an injury.</p>
